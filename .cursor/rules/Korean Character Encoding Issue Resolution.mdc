# Korean Character Encoding Issue Resolution Rules

## Precautions When Handling Korean Filenames/Folder Names in Windows PowerShell

### Problem Situation
- Encoding issues may occur when directly handling filenames or folder names containing Korean characters in Windows PowerShell.
- Especially with PowerShell commands like `Rename-Item`, `Move-Item`, Korean filenames may be displayed incorrectly or cause errors.

### Solution Methods

#### 1. Use Python Scripts (Recommended)
Always use Python scripts when handling Korean filenames/folder names:

```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import os

# When renaming files
os.rename('한글파일명.md', 'new_filename.md')

# When renaming folders
os.rename('한글폴더명', 'new_folder_name')
```

**Important Notes:**
- Always add the `# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-` encoding declaration at the top of Python script files.
- Write file/folder name change operations as separate Python script files and execute them.
- Delete temporary script files after completing the work.

#### 2. Prohibition of Direct PowerShell Usage
Do not use the following PowerShell commands when handling Korean filenames:
- `Rename-Item` (with Korean filenames directly)
- `Move-Item` (with Korean filenames directly)
- Using `&&` operator with Korean filenames

#### 3. Workflow
1. When handling Korean filenames/folder names:
   - Create a Python script file (include `# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-`)
   - Create a dictionary mapping filenames/folder names
   - Use `os.rename()` or `os.path` module
   - Execute the script
   - Delete temporary script files after completion

2. When batch processing multiple files:
   - Define mappings using dictionaries or lists
   - Process in batch using loops
   - Check existence at each step (`os.path.exists()`)

#### 4. Exception Handling
- Include `os.path.exists()` checks to handle cases where files/folders don't exist.
- Output clear error messages when errors occur.

### Example Template

```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import os

# Set working directory
os.chdir(r'c:\workspace\project_name')

# Filename change mapping
file_mappings = {
    '한글파일명1.md': 'english_filename1.md',
    '한글파일명2.md': 'english_filename2.md',
}

# Execute filename changes
for old_name, new_name in file_mappings.items():
    old_path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), old_name)
    new_path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), new_name)
    if os.path.exists(old_path):
        os.rename(old_path, new_path)
        print(f'Renamed: {old_name} -> {new_name}')
    else:
        print(f'File not found: {old_path}')
```

### Checklist
When working with Korean filenames/folder names, verify the following:
- [ ] Are you using a Python script file?
- [ ] Does the script have `# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-` at the top?
- [ ] Are you checking existence with `os.path.exists()`?
- [ ] Are you deleting temporary script files after completion?
